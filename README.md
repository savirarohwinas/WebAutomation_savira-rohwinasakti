# Project Web Automation Testing

Welcome to the Web Automation Testing project, a Java and Cucumber-based testing framework designed to validate the functionality of a web application. 
This project includes four key features: 
- Login (positive and negative scenarios)
- Add to Cart (positive scenario)
- Checkout (positive scenario)
- Logout (positive scenario)

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to automate the testing of a web application using Java, Cucumber, and Selenium, with a focus on both positive and negative test cases.

## Features
1. **Login**
    - Positive Scenarios: Successful login with valid credentials.
    - Negative Scenarios: Login with an invalid password.
2. **Add to Cart**
    - Positive Scenario: Confirm that an item can be added to the cart successfully.
3. **Checkout**
    - Positive Scenario: Validate the functionality of the checkout process, from adding an item to the cart to completing the purchase.
4. **Logout**
    - Positive Scenario: Test that users can log out of their account successfully.
